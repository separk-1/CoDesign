Q: What is EBCT?
A: EBCT (Empty Bed Contact Time) is the time calculated by dividing the empty bed volume (V) by the flow rate (Q). Formula: EBCT = V/Q.

Q: How is volume (V) calculated if diameter and height are given?
A: V(ft³) = π(D/2)²·H; V(gal) = V(ft³) × 7.48052.

Q: What are the risks of increasing flow rate (Q)?
A: Increasing flow increases throughput but decreases EBCT. Risks include reduced removal efficiency, higher ΔP, pump load, noise, uneven distribution, and shorter backwash cycles.

4. 엔지니어/디자이너 관점 차이

Q: What advice is given to designers when increasing volume (V)?
A: Designers are told that increasing volume extends contact time but also increases equipment size, cost, and backwash water; alternatives include slightly increasing diameter or adding parallel vessels.

Q: What advice is given to engineers for diameter (D)?
A: Engineers are advised that increasing D increases V, reduces superficial velocity, and decreases ΔP, but foundation/nozzle layout should be verified.

Q: What is the MCL for PFOS?
A: PFOS MCL refers to the drinking-water Maximum Contaminant Level for PFOS, set by local regulation. (노드 PFOS_MCL에서 반환)

6. 설계 기준과 규제 연계

Q: How does EBCT relate to PFAS guidelines?
A: EBCT is linked to guideline nodes (EBCT_guideline_PFAS), which connect to effluent targets for PFOA and PFOS, constrained by their MCL values.
